# isolation-game

Welcome to Isolation-game, an open-source FPS built with Unreal Engine and C++! I'll be providing you with all the code you actually need to get up and running with your very own advanced fps in Unreal Engine. As this is an open-source repository, I always welcome any sort of community involvment, so if you find bugs, better ways to do things, or just have a certain feature you'd love to see added, go ahead, submit a pull request, write out your own code, and then ask to merge it! Let's make Isolation-game better, together! (whoah I think that rhymed :D)

* If you're wondering how to go about getting Isolation-game up and running in your own projects, go ahead and check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/whoisEllie/isolation-game/wiki), which contains a quick start guide and pages on all the released classes, how their variables and functions work, and a summary of how that comes together as a piece of the larger Isolation-game puzzle. 

* A note on releases: These are 'finished' chunks of the game. They feature fully tested, commented code and will receive their own pages (or updated pages) in the wiki. If you'd like a fully covered experience, i'd recommend working only with released versions of the game code, though you're obviously free to use any of the code in this repository however you see fit. 

* A final note on licensing - everything uploaded to the Isolation-game repository is licensed under an MIT License, this means that you can use any and all of it however you see fit, without my explicit approval, and you don't owe me anything for using it. Your projects can be personal, educational, commercial, whatever you want. More on the MIT license [here](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).
