# Welcome to Project Isolation

Hi! Project Isolation is a fully open-source FPS. You can use it to study, learn, or even build your own games off of! However, if you'd like to create your own games based on the core of Project Isolation, i'd recommend using [FPS Core](https://github.com/whoisEllie/FPSCore), which includes 95% of the code that Project Isolation does, but comes with tutorials, documentation, and a support community, and a lot of bug fixes and improvements that haven't been backported to Project Isolation.
